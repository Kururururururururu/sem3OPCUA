\section{Introduction}

The goal of this project is to create a cyber-physical system, that includes a web interface, capable of communicating with a beer machine
through a OPC UA protocol. And a backend to ensure some automation of the brewing process.\newline

The web interface, and backend is built using the knowledge of http communication, html, javascript and css from “Web Technologies”,
and adhering to certain standards used in web development. 

From “Industrial Cyber-Physical Systems” we got a basic understanding of how machines like the beer machine operate, 
and how to connect through a OPC UA protocol.

We have used the knowledge from “Calculus og Lineær Algebra” to properly handle data.

In “Operating systems and distributed systems” we learned how to properly seperate the program, and proper deploy aa product.
