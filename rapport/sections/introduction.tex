\section{Introduction}

In this project we are working towardds creating an interface that can interact with a beer production machine using OPC UA. \newline

This interface needs to be user-friendly and be easy to use for anyone, as our primary targeted group is hobbyists, and other people who are interested in brewing beer. \newline
Aside from the viewable interface presented to the user, the program also needs features to make sure the production runs smoothly, and without major losses. \newline
This has to be done without needing a lot of input from the user, making it mostly automatic. \newline
