\section{Introduction}

The development of cyber-physical systems allows the physical and digital world to interact. 
The systems can for example simplify traditional processes executed by humans. 
In this project we create a cyber-physical system in which a web interface communicates with a beer machine through a OPC UA protocol. 
We rely on knowledge gained in this semester's courses to properly develop and test the machine in accordance with the project requirements.

As a basis, we were provided with a set of instructions. These included a guide on how to operate the physical beer machine from the company B\&R. 
Moreover, the instructions required us to implement a web based interface for the system. 
Furthermore, we had the opportunity to work with both a physical and a simulated version og the machine.
