\subsubsection{Limitations}
\subsubsubsection{Machine Speed Limitations}
The requirements we set for the failure rate,
is not possible to achieve on all the beer types,
as some require speeds outside the limitations set by the machine.

\subsubsection{Collaboration and Communication}
\subsubsubsection{Meetings}
Each thursday we scheduled a meeting on campus between 10:00 and 14:00,
to explain any doubts about code, or questions about writing the report.
This was done so everyone had some understanding of all the aspects 
of the codebase, and the report.


\subsubsubsection{Communication}
We had a group chat on messenger, where we would write in case we were late,
or sick.
Besides that we had a discord for sharing code, doing voice calls in case 
we didn't show up at the meeting, or had questions about the code 
outside of the scheduled meeting times.

\subsubsection{Workflow}
We took all our requirements, and split them into tasks we could work on, 
and added them to Jira.
