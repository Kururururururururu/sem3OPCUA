\subsection{Results}
\subsubsection{Achievements}
We managed to create a very thorough backend part for our application,
with all the functionality for automating the beer brewing process.
The frontend we've created is simple, but is able to communicate with the backend,
and allows the user to start the brewing process, and monitor the current inventory.

\subsubsection{Limitations}
\subsubsubsection{Machine Speed Limitations}
The requirements we set for the failure rate,
is not possible to achieve on all the beer types,
as some require speeds outside the limitations set by the machine.

\subsubsection{Collaboration and Communication}
\subsubsubsection{Meetings}
Each thursday we scheduled a meeting on campus between 10:00 and 14:00,
to explain any doubts about code, or questions about writing the report.
This was done so everyone had some understanding of all the aspects 
of the codebase, and the report.


\subsubsubsection{Communication}
We had a group chat on messenger, where we would write in case we were late,
or sick.
Besides that we had a discord for sharing code, doing voice calls in case 
we didn't show up at the meeting, or had questions about the code 
outside of the scheduled meeting times.

\subsubsection{Workflow}
We took all our requirements, and split them into tasks we could work on, 
and added them to Jira. When any task was completed the could would be uploaded,
to github, to make sure everyone had an updated version of the code.

\subsection{Future Improvements}
\subsubsection{Frontend}
The frontend is not fully functional, as the only two features currently implemted, are the brewing process, and the inventory.
We could still have the stop/start buttons implemented, and the ability to brew more than a single beer at a time.
