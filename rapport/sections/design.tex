\section{Design}
The project aims to develop a solution to automate and thereby ease the beer production process for the hobbyists, our design solution is strictly developed based on the previously mentioned personas and requirements.\newline
This process can under normal circumstances be a rather complex and very manual process, the user would have to manually control the temperature, add the correct ingredients and the right amount at the right time, while continuously monitoring the process to ensure that everything is going according to plan.\newline
The user might want to produce both produce multiple amounts, but also different kinds of beer. This would require the user to look-up each recipe every time to do the same recipe calculations based on the desired amount and beer type with every new batch, while monitoring and possibly adjusting the temperatures of the ingredients throughout the whole process for consistency.\newline
This process can quickly become overwhelming and tedious, especially for newcomers, and might lead to human errors as the production expands and in worst case, end up taking the joy out of the hobby.\newline
Our design goal is to make brewing easy and accessible to everyone, even for the least technical of people. We want to solve this issue by having a simple and clean user interface, without all the unnecessary information, where all the heavy calculations, continuous monitoring, and processing is done by software behind the scenes.\newline
The design aims to deter people from the seemingly advanced process of beer production by offering an intuitive and easy-to-use platform that removes the complexity and makes brewing accessible to every intrigued hobbyist.

\subsection{System Architecture}
The architecture of the system is based on the client-server model and include three deployments: The web-service, the database service, and the physical beer machine. \newline
The Web Service will consist of the front-end, back-end, and the OPC Client. There will be a direct line of communication between the user input in the user interface, through the data processing and handling in the backend, to the OPC Client that will handle the secure communication and instructions to the physical beer machine. \newline
The communication between the front-end, the back-end and the beer machine is implemented using a RESTful API. \newline
This deployment model ensures a clear separation of concerns, enabling efficient scaling in the future, while easing the maintenance of individual components.

\subsubsection{Frontend}
The user interface (UI) of the beer production system is developed using React, a powerful and easy-to-use JavaScript library with a lot of flexibility and efficiency in building interactive and dynamic user interfaces, which perfectly aligned with our goal of creating a user-friendly and responsive frontend for the beer production application.
In addition, Reacts offers a modular development environment in form of it's component-based design structure, this allows for the development of reusable UI elements, that can be combined to effortlessly form complex user interfaces. This helped the project to meet requirement U-01, to develop a user-friendly design, as each component can be developed and tested individually, before it's combined to form the final UI. \newline
The library also offers a virtual DOM (Document Object Model), which is a lightweight representation of the actual DOM, this allows for efficient rendering of the UI, as the virtual DOM only updates the necessary components, instead of re-rendering the whole UI every time a change is made. This helped the project to meet requirement U-02, to develop a responsive design, as the virtual DOM allows for efficient rendering of the UI, which in turn allows for a more responsive UI. \newline
Lastly it offered us a lot of flexibility in terms of state management, which is a crucial aspect of the project, as the UI needs to be able to handle a lot of different states, such as the different stages of the beer production process, and the different states of the beer machine. This helped the project to meet requirement U-03, to develop a dynamic design, as the UI can be updated to reflect the current state of the beer machine and it's progress. \newline
All these features, combined with the fact that it is a very popular and well-documented library, made it the perfect choice for the development of the user interface of the beer production system.
\subsubsubsection{User Interface}
To ensure we met requirement U-01, to develop a user-friendly design, we decided to develop a clean and simple user interface, without all the unnecessary information, to make it as easy as possible for the user to navigate and use the application. \newline
Therefore, an early draft of the user interface was developed to get a clear idea of the overall design and layout of the application. \newline

\subsubsection{Backend}
The backend component of the beer production system will be implemented using Node.js, a versatile JavaScript runtime known for its efficiency in building scalable and high-performance server-side applications. Leveraging the strengths of Node.js, we aim to create a secure and reliable back-end that seamlessly communicates with the front end and the PLC-controlled beer production machine.

Node.js for Asynchronous Operations
Node.js excels in handling asynchronous operations, making it well-suited for scenarios where real-time communication and responsiveness are crucial. This feature aligns perfectly with the requirements of our beer production system, allowing for efficient communication between the user interface and the hardware components.

RESTful API Development
The back end will expose a RESTful API (Application Programming Interface) to facilitate communication between the front end and the PLC-controlled beer production machine. This API will define endpoints for actions such as initiating the brewing process, retrieving data, and handling alerts or notifications. Node.js, with its lightweight and fast I/O operations, is ideal for developing RESTful APIs.

Secure Communication
Security is paramount in the back-end design. Node.js offers robust libraries and modules for implementing secure communication protocols, such as HTTPS. This ensures that data exchanged between the front end and the beer production machine is encrypted, minimizing the risk of unauthorized access.

Data Storage with NoSQL Database
For efficient data storage and retrieval, a NoSQL database, such as MongoDB, will be employed. Node.js seamlessly integrates with NoSQL databases, offering a flexible and scalable solution for storing data related to beer recipes, production logs, and system configurations.

WebSocket for Real-Time Communication
To enable real-time communication and push notifications to the front end, WebSocket technology will be implemented using Node.js. This bidirectional communication channel ensures that users receive immediate updates on the brewing process, alerts, or any other relevant information.

Containerization for Scalability
In line with the project's emphasis on scalability, containerization technologies like Docker and Kubernetes will be utilized. Node.js applications can be efficiently containerized, providing a scalable and easily deployable solution. This approach ensures that the back-end infrastructure can adapt to increased load or additional features in the future.

Logging and Monitoring
Node.js provides robust logging mechanisms, allowing for the systematic recording of events and errors. Monitoring tools will be integrated to track the performance and health of the back-end system. This ensures that any issues can be promptly identified and addressed.

Testing and Continuous Integration
The Node.js back end will undergo thorough testing to validate its functionality, security, and scalability. Continuous Integration (CI) practices will be implemented to automate the testing process, ensuring that each code change is rigorously assessed for quality and reliability.

In summary, the use of Node.js for back-end development brings scalability, real-time communication, and security to the beer production system. By leveraging the strengths of Node.js, we aim to create a robust foundation that seamlessly integrates with the front end and effectively communicates with the PLC-controlled beer production machine.

\subsection{Simulation}
Incorporating the provided ARsim simulation tool early on into our development process was a crucial aspect of this project. 
The early integration allowed us to speed up the development time from the very beginning of the project, as most of our program's functionalities could be tested directly without the need for direct access to the physical machine.
As the tool allowed us to interact with ARsim in a manner similar to how our software would communicate with the actual hardware, it also enabled multiple people to test multiple different things without interfering with one another.
% ARsim serves as a valuable resource that enables simulation of the beer production process without the need for direct access to the physical machine. 
%This simulation tool will be instrumental in testing and refining our software application.

\subsubsection{ARsim Integration}
The ARsim simulation tool was integrated early into the development process, to mimic the behavior of the beer machine.
The early integration allowed us to speed up the development time from the very beginning of the project, as most of our program's functionalities could be tested directly without the need of the physical beer machine.
