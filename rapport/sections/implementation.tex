\subsubsection{Approach}
Our software development approach is based on the agile methodology. The agile methodology is a software methodology that is based on iterative and incremental design
which allows us to change the requirements and the design of the system while the devleoping process is ongoing. \newline

To help us give an indication of the process, we decided to split the project into different sprints. Each sprint is a period of time, that is used to work on specific tasks that where set for the given sprint.
each sprint is divided into time frames around two weeks. By using this methodology, we can work on the project in a more strcutured way, which allows us to focus on the tasks set for the sprint,
and it also gives a better understading of the development and progress made. It also helps us to keep track of all tasks if something was not made during the sprint. By doing it this way, we could look at the earlier sprint and complete the different tasks that where not complete. \newline
